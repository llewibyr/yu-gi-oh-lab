# Origin Story!
It's the late 90's, where a simple game of cards took the world by storm. Yu-Gi-Oh became one of the biggest kids show since Pokemon, teaching us the fundamentals of friendship, believing in yourself, puting your fate in others and also trusting the heart of the cards

- We as kids grew up watching Yu-Gi-Oh and it changed our entire lives keeping us out of the streets, so we wanted to give back!!!

- Users will be able to add and create their own Yu-Gi-Oh cards in the database.

- Users will be able to define the card attributes (e.g., name, type, effect, etc.).

- Users will ba able to - Handle Adding, Removing, and Displaying cards and decks.
